make commands:
    make - compiles Arithmetic
    make Arithmetic - compiles Arithmetic
    make BigIntegerTest / ListTest compiles tests
    make clean

Arithmetic.c - client use for BigInteger ADT
BigInteger.c - ADT for very large numbers
List.c - ADT for lists, used in BigInteger ADT
Makefile - compiles stuff

Design Decisions:
I made the lists go from least to most significant so it would be easier to turn them from linked lists into vectors.
I also never have negative numbers from adding and subtracting, which made things a lot easier to work with and reason about.

Usage:
make and then
./Arithmetic "infile" "outfile"

Input file format:
Input takes in 4 lines, representing 2 numbers. The first and third line are how many digits the number is.
Lines 2 and 4 are the number with exactly as many digits as specified, and an optional +/- sign.

Output file format:
A,
B,
A+B,
A-B,
A-A,
3A-2B,
A*A (A^2),
9(A^4) + 16(b^5),
